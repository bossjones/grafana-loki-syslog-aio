# Default syslog-ng.conf file which collects all local logs into a
# single file called /var/log/messages tailored to container usage.
#
# The changes from the stock, default syslog-ng.conf file is that we've
# dropped the system() source that is not needed and that we enabled network
# connections using default-network-drivers(). Customize as needed and
# override using the -v option to docker, such as:
#
#  docker run ...  -v "$PWD/syslog-ng.conf":/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf

# source: Read, receive, and collect log messages

# A source is where syslog-ng receives log messages. Sources consist of one or more drivers, each defining where and how messages are received.
# internal(): Messages generated by syslog-ng.
# network(transport("udp")): Messages arriving to the 514/UDP port of any interface of the host.
# unix-dgram("/dev/log");: Messages arriving to the /dev/log socket.
# source s_demo {
#     internal();
#     network(transport("udp"));
#     unix-dgram("/dev/log");
# };
source s_local {
	internal();
};

# The default-network-drivers() source is a special source that uses multiple source drivers to receive and parse several different types of syslog messages from the network. Available in version 3.16 and later.
# Also, make sure that your SELinux, AppArmor, and firewall settings permit syslog-ng Open Source Edition to access the ports where you want to receive messages, and that no other application is using these ports. By default, the default-network-drivers() source accepts messages on the following ports:

# 514, both TCP and UDP, for RFC3164 (BSD-syslog) formatted traffic

# 601 TCP, for RFC5424 (IETF-syslog) formatted traffic

# 6514 TCP, for TLS-encrypted traffic
# https://www.syslog-ng.com/technical-documents/doc/syslog-ng-open-source-edition/3.30/administration-guide/18#TOPIC-1594914
